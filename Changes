    - Add missing exit() to t/QuotedPrint.t.  [Karl Williamson, PR#1]

0.09 2020-12-08

    - Added INSTALLDIRS, accounting for the @INC reordering change in Perl 5.12.
      See Perl RT#116479 for details.  (PerlIO-via-QuotedPrint entered the perl
      core in Perl 5.8.0 so that's what the lower bound of the check should
      strictly be, but since we only support Perl 5.8.1 and higher anyway we do
      not need to check the lower bound.  The upper bound is correctly Perl
      5.11.0 since the @INC reordering change in question (Perl core commit
      #b9ba2fadb1) first appeared in Perl 5.11.0.)

    - Added optional Changes testing (skipped unless AUTHOR_TESTING).

    - Reformatted Changes file as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.

    - Added optional POD coverage testing (skipped unless AUTHOR_TESTING).

    - Added optional POD testing (skipped unless AUTHOR_TESTING).

    - Added optional Perl::Critic testing (skipped unless AUTHOR_TESTING).

    - Made code Perl::Critic clean.

    - Included GitHub repository URLs in metadata now that source code has been
      uploaded to GitHub.

    - Set minimum required ExtUtils::MakeMaker version to 6.64 to ensure that
      all parameters used are supported, to save jumping through hoops to
      support earlier versions.  (This should not be a problem since
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.64 is easily installed into Perl 5.8.1 and above,
      that being the whole point of the new choice of minimum supported Perl
      version.)

    - Set minimum required Perl version to 5.8.1.  This is in line with the
      minimum requirement of the "Perl Toolchain".

0.08 2015-05-18

    - Synchronized t/QuotedPrint.t with the core perl version.

0.07 2012-04-05

    - Brought up to date with current code esthetics.  Verified it runs on
      5.14.2, threaded and unthreaded.

    - Made sure the test-suite cleans up on multi-versioned systems.

0.06 2003-12-28

    - Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.05 2003-08-13

    - Cleaned up Makefile.PL and updated copyright info.  Made sure the
      test-suite runs with strict and warnings enabled.

0.04 2002-07-11

    - Adapted Perl core magic in test-suite to conform to Jarkko Hietaniemi's
      official magic.

    - Rearranged top of source to not need fully qualified VERSION anymore.

    - Checked for defined() problems: none found.

0.03 2002-07-10

    - Added Perl CORE magic pragma to test-suite.  Changed name of test-suite to
      QuotedPrint.t to facilitate inclusion in Perl core.

    - Migrated to the PerlIO::via:: namespace.

0.02 2002-07-09

    - Fixed some documentation nits reported by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.

    - Version number now a '' string (oops).

    - Changed object to glob reference instead of list reference.  Should be a
      little memory saving.

0.01 2002-07-01

    - Migrated from the now obsoleted IOLayer:: namespace.
